# Bookmarker

This is a simple bookmarker application made in Javascript. It takes a website name and a URL and prints the output bookmark in front of you on the screen with the option of visiting the URL you inserted or deleting the bookmark if you don't want it anymore.

The websites you bookmarked are saved in the local storage of the browser so the bookmarks are saved even if you closed the browser tab or reloaded it again

The application layout is made in HTML and Bootstrap. You can find the application here: http://bit.ly/2JDdCzp

### Further improvements
- Prevent duplicate URLs from being bookmarked
- Ask for confirmation before deleting a bookmark
